# python_project
Hello Everyone !!!
This is my Python Projet.The data that I used in this Project is related to the Women Soccer Worldcup 2019.
My main aim of doing this project is to find out which country scored maximum total goals in the Worlcup.To see the results 
clearly I used bar graph.I also tried to answer some other question like which players position scored how many goals and 
number of players who scored a goal for their country.

I used a bar graph to show the different country with their number of goals,a Pie chart for displaying the percentage of goals interms of Players position, 
and again I used bar graph to show how many players does a country have who scored a goals in tournament.

Dependncies: os, pandas, sqlite3, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
